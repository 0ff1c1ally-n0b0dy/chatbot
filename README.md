# chatbot

This is using the turial from the following link: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html 

*try_chatbot_V7* is basically the same, the only difference is that I created 2 double directional GRUs on the hidden layers of another GRU in the encoder.
*chatbotV7_conversation_ex.png* contains an example of a conversation with this chatbot trained for only 1 hour on the data in the folder *data*.
